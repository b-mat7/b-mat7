# Hey there, I'm Matthias ðŸ™‹
### An ITSM veteran that switched to the dark side of the force


## About me
For over a decade, I've helped companies build and enhance their process capabilities, primarily in ITSM (IT Service Management). I have contributed across different industries, at various stages of company growth, and at multiple organizational levels. I was a process owner, team lead and departmental consultant. I accompanied ITSM platform integrations and leveraged scripting to push the envelope, aligning tool capabilities with business needs.

Technology, software, and all the engineering work behind the scenes have always fascinated me. Witnessing whatâ€™s possible beyond any low-code UI amplified my interest, and I decided to follow it by transitioning from working with engineers to working as an engineer. I enjoy building things and solving problems, and as such I've discovered another passion in developing software.

I take pleasure in broadening my horizons and continuously refining my skills. The diverse experiences I've gained in previous roles enable me to switch hats and think outside the box, especially as a software developer.

I am determined, optimistic, with a hands-on mentality and a bit of perfectionism. In my free time, you can find me biking and enjoying nature with my family â€” collect moments, not things!

Below are some fun projects from my early dev days. Current ones will be published once finished (if time permits ðŸ‘¶)
